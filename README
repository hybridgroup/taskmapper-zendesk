# ticketmaster-skeleton
This is the skeleton project for creating a Ticketmaster provider. You should replace this README with your own info, once you have used the skeleton to create your own provder.

Ticketmaster is a universal API to ticket tracking and project management system. It uses a plugin "provider" architecture to make it easy to integrate with any back-end system.

To start a new provider, simply do the following:
*Clone this repo
*Use git archive to create a copy in the directory you want to use for your new provider. For example:
  cd /path/to/ticketmaster-provider-skeleton
  git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/path/to/ticketmaster-newprovider/
Note that "/path/to/ticketmaster-newprovider/" appears to need to be a full path to the target  
*Start modifying that copy, and commit it to your own repo. Make sure to name it using the convention ticketmaster-X where X is the name of your backend system

Thanks for using Ticketmaster!
